        <p>
          With over 3 years of front-end development experience, I specialize in turning complex problems into
          intuitive, user-friendly web applications. My toolkit includes React, TypeScript, and SCSS, but what really
          drives me is the challenge of optimizing performance and enhancing user experience. Whether Iâ€™m breathing new
          life into legacy systems or creating dynamic, real-time features, Iâ€™m all about delivering solutions that are
          both innovative and practical. I thrive on collaboration and continuous learning, always looking for ways to
          push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in web development.
